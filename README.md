# 📧 Phishing Email Classifier

A machine learning-based phishing detection system that uses NLP to classify emails as phishing or legitimate. This project includes both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web interface built with Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Classifies emails as **Phishing** or **Safe**
- 🧠 Uses **TF-IDF** for feature extraction
- 🤖 Logistic Regression model for classification
- 🧼 Preprocesses raw email content (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- 🌐 Streamlit app for interactive user experience
- 💾 Model and vectorizer are saved using `joblib`

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Contents of `requirements.txt`:


pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
streamlit




## 📥 Dataset

This project uses a labeled phishing email dataset. You can use the one from Kaggle:

**[Phishing Email Detection Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charlesherreraphishingemails)**

Ensure the CSV is saved as:


data/phishing_emails.csv


---

## 🧪 Model Training

To train the model from scratch:


cd src
python train_model.py


This will:
- Load and clean the dataset
- Vectorize the email text using TF-IDF
- Train a logistic regression model
- Save the model and vectorizer in the `models/` folder

---

## 💻 Run the CLI Predictor


cd src
python predict.py


Paste in email content, press Enter twice, and it will return:

- ✅ "SAFE"  
- ⚠️ "PHISHING"



## 🌐 Launch the Streamlit App

From the project root:


streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py


Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.



## 🧠 Example Input


Subject: Urgent - Verify Your Account

- IT Support


Output:

⚠️ This email is likely a PHISHING attempt.
